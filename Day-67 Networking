Networking:

Networking is the exchange of information and ideas among people with a common profession or special interest,
usually in an informal social setting. Networking often begins with a single point of common ground.
Professionals use networking to expand their circles of acquaintances,
find out about job opportunities in their fields,
and increase their awareness of news and trends in their fields or the greater world.
