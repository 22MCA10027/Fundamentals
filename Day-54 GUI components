The most basic GUI elements you will be dealing with in Java include what are known as containers and components. 
A container is used to store the items the user will see on display, such as a panel or a frame (main window).
These are the very core of what holds everything together and are the primary skeletal system of the GUI as a whole.

Components can be described as the add-ons or extensions to the containers that help to fill in the content 
and make up the rest of the user interface.
Examples can include things such as a 
textbox,
a checkbox,
command box, 
Scroll bar,
window,
a radio button,
or even a simple label, etc.
