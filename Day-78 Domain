Domain:

A domain name is the identity of one or more IP addresses; for example, 
the domain name google.com points to the IP address "74.125.127.147". 
Domain names are invented as it is easy to remember a name rather than a long string of numbers.
It would be easy to enter a domain name in the search bar than a long sequence of numbers.
So,
It is the web address of your website that people need to type in the browser URL bar to visit your website. 
In simple words, suppose your website is a house, then the domain name is its address.
