Distributed Computing : 

In a distributed computing environment multiple nodes are connected together
using network but physically they are separated.
A single task is performed by different functional units of different nodes of distributed unit.
Here different programs of an application run simultaneously on different nodes, 
and communication happens in between different nodes of this system over network to solve task.
