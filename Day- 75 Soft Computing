Soft computing:

Soft Computing is the reverse of hard (conventional) computing.
 It refers to a group of computational techniques 
that are based on artificial intelligence (AI) 
and natural selection.
 It provides cost-effective solutions to the complex real-life problems 
for which hard computing solution does not exist.
Zadeh coined the term of soft computing in 1992.
 The objective of soft computing is to provide precise approximation
 and quick solutions for complex real-life problems.
