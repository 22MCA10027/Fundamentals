Software Engineering:

Software is a program or set of programs containing instructions that provide desired functionality.
And Engineering is the process of designing and building something that serves a particular purpose and finds a cost-effective solution to problems. 
Software Engineering is mainly used for large projects based on software systems rather than single programs or applications. 
The main goal of software Engineering is to develop software application for improving the quality,  budget and time efficiency.
Software Engineering ensures that the software that has to built should be consistent, correct, also on budget, on time and within the required requirements.
