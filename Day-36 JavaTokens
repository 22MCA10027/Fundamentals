Java Tokens:

In Java, the program contains classes and methods. 
Further, the methods contain the expressions 
and statements required to perform a specific operation. 
These statements and expressions are made up of tokens.
In other words, we can say that the expression and statement is a set of tokens.
The tokens are the small building blocks of a Java program that are meaningful to the Java compiler.
