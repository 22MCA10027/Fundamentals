Decision Making Statements:

Decision Making in programming is similar to decision-making in real life.
In programming also face some situations where we want a certain block of code to be executed when some condition is fulfilled. 
A programming language uses control statements to control the flow of execution of a program based on certain conditions.
These are used to cause the flow of execution to advance and branch based on changes to the state of a program.
