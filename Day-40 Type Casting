Type Casting:

In Java, type casting is a method or process that converts a data type into another data type in both ways manually and automatically. 
The automatic conversion is done by the compiler and manual conversion performed by the programmer.

There are two types of type casting:

Widening Type Casting
Narrowing Type Casting

Widening Type Casting:

Converting a lower data type into a higher one is called widening type casting.
It is also known as implicit conversion or casting down. It is done automatically.

Narrowing Type Casting:
Converting a higher data type into a lower one is called narrowing type casting.
It is also known as explicit conversion or casting up. It is done manually by the programmer.
