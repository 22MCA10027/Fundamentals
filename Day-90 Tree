Tree:

A Tree is a non-linear data structure and a hierarchy consisting of a collection of nodes.
such that each node of the tree stores a value and a list of references to other nodes (the “children”).
This data structure is a specialized method to organize and store data in the computer to be used more effectively. 
It consists of a central node, structural nodes, and sub-nodes, which are connected via edges. 
We can also say that tree data structure has roots, branches, and leaves connected with one another.
