Mongo DB:

MongoDB is an open-source, cross-platform, distributed document database. 
MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc. and categorized as a NoSQL database.
Mongo DB is easy to use.
MongoDB is a document-oriented database. 
It uses the concept of the document to store data,
which is more flexible than the row concept in the relational database management system (RDBMS).
A document allows you to represent complex hierarchical relationships with a single record.
MongoDB doesnâ€™t require predefined schemas that allow you to add to or remove fields from documents more quickly.
