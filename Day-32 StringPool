StringPool:

String pool is nothing but a storage area in Java heap where string literals stores.
It is also known as String Intern Pool or String Constant Pool. It is just like object allocation.
By default, it is empty and privately maintained by the Java String class.
Whenever we create a string the string object occupies some space in the heap memory.
Creating a number of strings may increase the cost and memory too which may reduce the performance also.
