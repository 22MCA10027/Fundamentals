Grid Computing:

It is a distributed system.
in which all works together to reach common goal.
Grid Computing can be defined as a network of computers working together to perform a task 
that would rather be difficult for a single machine. 
All machines on that network work under the same protocol to act as a virtual supercomputer.
The task that they work on may include analyzing huge datasets
or simulating situations that require high computing power. 
Computers on the network contribute resources like processing power 
and storage capacity to the network.
