Abstract Classes:
It define a superclass that declares the structure 
of a given abstraction without providing a 
complete implementation of every method. 
 We can create a superclass that only defines a 
generalized form that will be shared by all of its 
subclasses, leaving it to each subclass to fill in 
the details. 
 This situation can occur is when a superclass is 
unable to create a meaningful implementation 
for a method
  In this abstract class, we can't achieve 100% abstraction 
I.e., we can't achieve full security to our data.
  Any class that contains one or more abstract methods 
must also be declared abstract.
