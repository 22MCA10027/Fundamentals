JVM(Java Virtual Machine):

JVM acts as a run-time engine to run Java applications.
JVM is the one that actually calls the main method present in a java code.
JVM is a part of JRE(Java Runtime Environment).
Java applications are called WORA (Write Once Run Anywhere).
This means a programmer can develop Java code on one system and 
can expect it to run on any other Java-enabled system without any adjustment.
This is all possible because of JVM.
JVM convert .class file into bytecode for compilation.
