FileOutputStream:

FileOutputStream is an outputstream for writing data/streams of raw bytes to file or storing data to file.
FileOutputStream is a subclass of OutputStream. To write primitive values into a file, we use FileOutputStream class.
For writing byte-oriented and character-oriented data,
we can use FileOutputStream but for writing character-oriented data, FileWriter is more preferred.
