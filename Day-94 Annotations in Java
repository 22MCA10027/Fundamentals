Annotations in Java:

Annotations start with ‘@’.
Annotations do not change the action of a compiled program.
Annotations help to associate metadata (information) to the program elements 
i.e. instance variables, constructors, methods, classes, etc.
Annotations are not pure comments as they can change the way a program is treated by the compiler. 
See below code for example.
Annotations basically are used to provide additional information,
so could be an alternative to XML and Java marker interfaces.
