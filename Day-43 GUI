GUI:

GUI stands for Graphical User Interface.
GUI is an interface that allows users to interact with different 
electronic devices using icons and other visual indicators.
The graphical user interfaces were created because command line interfaces 
were quite complicated and it was difficult to learn all the commands in it.
In todayâ€™s times, graphical user interfaces are used in many devices
such as mobiles, MP3 players, gaming devices, smartphones etc.
