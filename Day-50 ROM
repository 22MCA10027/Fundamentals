ROM:
ROM, which stands for read only memory,
In which we can store the data information permanently.
It is also the primary memory unit of a computer along with the random access memory (RAM).
It is called read only memory as we can only read the programs and data stored on it but cannot write on it. 
It is restricted to reading words that are permanently stored within the unit.
In which we can't reprogram, rewrite, or erase its content later. However, there are some types of ROM where you can modify the data.
