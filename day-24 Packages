Packages:

Packages are containers for classes that are used to 
keep the class name space compartmentalized.

Java provides a mechanism forpartitioning the class
name space into more manageable chunks.
this mechanism is package.

Package is both a naming and a visibility control
mechanism.

You can define classes inside a package that 
are not acessable by code outside that package.

You can also define class members that are only exposed 
to other rmembers of the same package.
